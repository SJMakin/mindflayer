- Save / load conversation
- Images








1. Add a search bar to allow users to find previous messages or conversations quickly.

3. Allow users to customize the appearance of their messages, like adding emojis or changing the font and color.

5. Implement a chat history feature that saves previous conversations, so users can access them at any time.

6. Add an auto-complete feature to help users complete their messages quicker and more accurately.

8. Integrate a feature that suggests relevant responses or actions based on the content of the messages.

9. Implement a feature that allows users to easily switch between different languages, especially if the AI agent can communicate in multiple languages.

10. Consider incorporating a voice-to-text feature that allows users to verbally dictate their messages instead of typing them.

1. Add a feature that enables the user to save the conversation timeline as a tree-like structure, showing the various branches and paths the conversation took. This could provide a better overview of the conversation, and allow the user to quickly navigate to previous parts of the conversation.

2. Implement a feature that allows the user to visualize the conversation as an interactive timeline. This could help the user understand the progression of the conversation and where they've been when revisiting the conversation.

3. Offer the user an option to paraphrase or re-phrase their previous message to help refine the AI's understanding of their question or request. This could improve the accuracy of the AI's response in cases where the original message was misunderstood.

4. Provide suggestions for follow-up questions based on the AI's response. This could help prompt the user to ask clarifying questions or take the conversation in a different direction.

5. Implement a feature that enables the user to record the conversation with the AI agent. This could be useful in cases where the conversation contains important or sensitive information.

6. Consider incorporating a feature that allows the user to flag parts of the conversation for future reference, such as interesting or particularly useful parts of the chat. This could help the user quickly find the relevant part of the conversation at a later time.

7. Add a feature that enables the user to control the speed at which the AI agent responds. This could come in handy when the user needs more time to absorb or respond to the previous message.

8. Consider adding a feature that suggests similar conversations or discussions to the current one. This could help the user explore similar topics to their current inquiry, providing a wider range of information and input.
